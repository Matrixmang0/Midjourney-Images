# Generative AI Image Analysis  

## Overview  
This project involves generating images using the **MidJourney model** to analyze biases, stereotypes, and cultural representations across different countries. The analysis focuses on five generic categories applied to six countries: China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and the United States.  

## Folder Structure  
The outer folder is organized by year to store outputs of the models. Currently, only the **2024** folder exists, containing the outputs generated in that year.
