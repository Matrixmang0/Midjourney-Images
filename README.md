# Generative AI Image Analysis  

## Overview  
This project involves generating images using the **MidJourney model** to analyze biases, stereotypes, and cultural representations across different countries. The analysis focuses on five generic categories applied to six countries: China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and the United States.

## Folder Structure  
The outer folder is organized by year to store outputs of the models. Currently, only the **2024** folder exists, containing the outputs generated in that year.

## Inspiration

This work was inspired by the article [“AI image stereotypes”](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/) published by **Rest of World** in 2023. In the article, Victoria Turk and her team analyzed similar generative AI biases using an earlier version of MidJourney.
